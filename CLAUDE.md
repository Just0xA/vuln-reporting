# CLAUDE.MD — Vulnerability Management Reporting Suite (pyTenable)

## Project Overview

Build a modular Python reporting suite that connects to **Tenable.io / Tenable Vulnerability Management** via the `pyTenable` SDK and produces meaningful, audience-specific vulnerability management reports. Reports are segmented by **Tenable Tags/Labels**, support three distinct audience formats, and are exported as **CSV/Excel, PDF, and matplotlib/plotly charts**.

The suite supports **scheduled and on-demand execution**, with a YAML-driven delivery system that emails the right reports to the right recipients — each group with its own filters, report selection, frequency, and recipient list that can be updated without touching code.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **pyTenable** — primary SDK for all Tenable API calls
- **pandas** — data manipulation and aggregation
- **openpyxl** — Excel (.xlsx) output with formatting
- **matplotlib + plotly** — charts and visualizations
- **reportlab or weasyprint** — PDF generation
- **python-dotenv** — credential management via `.env`
- **PyYAML** — recipient group and schedule configuration
- **APScheduler** — embedded scheduler (also cron/Task Scheduler compatible)
- **smtplib + email.mime** — SMTP email delivery (Office 365, Gmail, etc.)
- **Jinja2** — HTML email body templating
- **tenacity** — API retry/backoff
- **rich** — CLI progress/status output

---

## Credential Management

All credentials must be loaded exclusively from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`. Never hardcode credentials.

```
# .env
TVM_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
TVM_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
TVM_URL=https://cloud.tenable.com

# SMTP
SMTP_HOST=smtp.office365.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=reports@yourcompany.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=reports@yourcompany.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Vulnerability Management Reports
```

Instantiate the Tenable client like this:

```python
from tenable.io import TenableIO
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
tio = TenableIO(
    access_key=os.getenv("TVM_ACCESS_KEY"),
    secret_key=os.getenv("TVM_SECRET_KEY")
)
```

Validate connection on startup and exit gracefully with a clear error message if authentication fails.

---

## SLA Definitions

Severity is determined by the **VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating)** score provided by Tenable,
not the native CVSS-based severity field. Always derive severity from the `vpr_score` field.

| Severity | VPR Score Range | SLA (Days to Remediate) |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0      | 15 days                 |
| High     | 7.0 – 8.9       | 30 days                 |
| Medium   | 4.0 – 6.9       | 90 days                 |
| Low      | 0.1 – 3.9       | 180 days                |

A vulnerability with no VPR score should fall back to native Tenable severity.

A vulnerability is **overdue** when: `today - first_found_date > SLA_days` AND it has not been remediated.

Define these as constants in a shared `config.py`:

```python
SLA_DAYS = {
    "critical": 15,
    "high": 30,
    "medium": 90,
    "low": 180
}
```

---

## Asset Segmentation

All reports must support **filtering and grouping by Tenable Tags/Labels**. Tags should be:

- Fetched dynamically from the API at runtime (do not hardcode tag values)
- Usable as CLI `--tag-category` and `--tag-value` arguments to scope any report
- Defined per recipient group in `delivery_config.yaml` (see below)
- Included as a column/dimension in all aggregated outputs

Example CLI usage:

```bash
python report_sla.py --tag-category "Business Unit" --tag-value "Finance"
python report_executive.py --tag-category "Environment" --tag-value "Production"
```

If no tag filter is provided, reports run against **all assets**.

## Delivery Configuration — `delivery_config.yaml`

This is the **single file** that controls who gets what, with what filters, and how often. It must be fully editable without touching any Python code. Adding/removing recipients, changing filters, or adjusting schedules requires only editing this file.

```yaml
# delivery_config.yaml

### YAML Schema Rules

- `frequency` must be `weekly`, `monthly`, or `on_demand`
- `day_of_week` is required when `frequency: weekly`; must be one of `monday`–`sunday`; ignored otherwise
- `day_of_month` is required when `frequency: monthly`; must be an integer between 1 and 28 (28 max to avoid last-day-of-month issues in February); ignored otherwise
- `time` is required for `frequency: weekly` and `frequency: monthly`; format `HH:MM` (24-hour, server local time); ignored for `on_demand`
- `filters` may be empty `{}` to run against all assets
- `reports` must be a list from: `executive_kpi`, `sla_remediation`, `asset_risk`, `patch_compliance`, `trend_analysis`, `plugin_cve`
- `recipients` is a required list; `cc` may be empty
- Validate the YAML schema on startup and exit with a clear error if misconfigured
- Build a `delivery_config.schema.yaml` (JSON Schema format) so the config can be validated by editors and CI

---

## Scheduler — `scheduler.py`

Build a flexible scheduler supporting three execution modes so teams can adopt whatever fits their infrastructure.

### Mode 1: APScheduler Daemon (always-on process)

```bash
python scheduler.py --mode daemon
```

- Reads `delivery_config.yaml` on startup and schedules all `weekly` and `monthly` groups via APScheduler `CronTrigger`
- Hot-reloads `delivery_config.yaml` every 5 minutes — reschedules changed groups without restart
- Logs all scheduled jobs and executions to `logs/scheduler.log`
- Designed to run as a background process via `nohup` or a `systemd` service
- Include a sample `systemd` unit file in the repo: `deploy/vuln-reports.service`

### Mode 2: Single-Run (cron / Windows Task Scheduler compatible)

```bash
python scheduler.py --mode run-due
```

- Reads `delivery_config.yaml` and executes only groups whose schedule (`day_of_week` + `time` for weekly; `day_of_month` + `time` for monthly) matches the current time within a ±10-minute window
- Designed to be called by an external scheduler every 5–10 minutes
- Example crontab:
  ```
  */10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /opt/vuln-reporting/scheduler.py --mode run-due >> /var/log/vuln-reports.log 2>&1
  ```
- Windows Task Scheduler: trigger every 10 minutes, action: `python scheduler.py --mode run-due`

### Mode 3: Manual / On-Demand

```bash
# Run a specific group by name
python scheduler.py --mode manual --group "Finance Remediation Team"

# Run all groups with frequency: on_demand
python scheduler.py --mode manual --all-on-demand

# Override recipients at runtime (useful for testing or ad-hoc requests)
python scheduler.py --mode manual --group "Ad-Hoc Production Snapshot" --recipients test@company.com,manager@company.com

# Generate reports but skip email delivery
python scheduler.py --mode manual --group "Executive Team" --no-email
```

All three modes call the same underlying `run_group(group_config)` function — behavior is identical regardless of how it is triggered.

---

## Email Delivery — `delivery/email_sender.py`

### Email Structure

Every delivery email must include all of the following:

1. **HTML body** (Jinja2 template) containing:
   - Report title, generation timestamp, and group name
   - Scope banner: tag filter applied (e.g., "Scope: Environment = Production") or "All Assets"
   - **KPI summary strip**: Total Criticals open, % Critical/High within SLA, count of overdue Critical+High, overall MTTR
   - **Inline charts**: top 2–3 charts embedded as base64 CID images (`<img src="cid:chart_1">`) so they render in Outlook and Gmail without downloading attachments
   - Bullet list of attached reports with one-line descriptions
   - SLA reference table (4 rows)
   - Footer: reply-to address, generation timestamp, instructions for updating recipients or filters

2. **PDF attachments** — one per report in the group's report list

3. **Excel attachments** — one per report in the group's report list

### SMTP Implementation

```python
def send_report_email(group_config: dict, report_outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """
    group_config: parsed group from delivery_config.yaml
    report_outputs: {report_name: {pdf: path, excel: path, charts: [path, ...]}}
    Returns True on success, False on failure — logs error, never raises
    """
```

- Use STARTTLS (port 587) by default; support SSL (port 465) via env var override
- Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff on transient SMTP failures (`tenacity`)
- Validate all recipient email addresses before attempting send
- Enforce a configurable `MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_MB` (default: 25MB total). If exceeded: log a warning, send PDF only, note in email body that Excel was omitted due to size
- Never send to an empty recipient list — log and skip if `recipients` resolves to zero valid addresses

---

## Email Template — `templates/report_email.html`

Build a Jinja2 HTML email template that is:

- Compatible with Outlook, Gmail, and Apple Mail — **inline CSS only**, no external stylesheets or `<style>` blocks
- Structured with these sections in order:
  1. **Header band**: Report title + date generated
  2. **Scope banner**: Filter applied or "All Assets"
  3. **KPI tiles** (4–5 metric boxes, table-based layout for email client compatibility): Total Criticals, % Within SLA, Overdue High+Critical, MTTR
  4. **Inline charts**: `<img src="cid:chart_N">` placeholders — up to 3 charts
  5. **Attached reports list**: bullet list with report name + one-line description
  6. **SLA reference table**: 4-row table
  7. **Footer**: reply-to, timestamp, "To update recipients or report filters, contact: [reply_to address]"

---

## Delivery Log — `delivery/delivery_log.py`

Maintain a **SQLite audit log** at `logs/delivery_log.db`.

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE delivery_log (
    id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp           DATETIME NOT NULL,
    group_name          TEXT NOT NULL,
    trigger_mode        TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'scheduled' | 'manual' | 'daemon'
    reports_run         TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON array
    tag_filter          TEXT,               -- "Category=Value" or "all_assets"
    recipients          TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON array
    status              TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'success' | 'partial' | 'failed'
    error_message       TEXT,               -- NULL on success
    output_folder       TEXT NOT NULL,
    attachment_size_kb  INTEGER,
    duration_seconds    REAL
);
```

### CLI for log inspection

```bash
python delivery/delivery_log.py --recent 20
python delivery/delivery_log.py --failures
python delivery/delivery_log.py --group "Executive Team"
python delivery/delivery_log.py --from 2025-01-01 --to 2025-01-31
```

---

## `run_all.py` — Master Runner

```bash
# Run all groups that are due (scheduled mode)
python run_all.py

# Run a specific group with full delivery
python run_all.py --group "Finance Remediation Team"

# Generate reports only, no email
python run_all.py --group "Executive Team" --no-email

# Dry run: validate config and show what would be sent
python run_all.py --dry-run

# Override tag filter at runtime
python run_all.py --group "Ad-Hoc Production Snapshot" --tag-category "Environment" --tag-value "Staging"

# Override recipients at runtime
python run_all.py --group "Executive Team" --recipients test@company.com
```

Saves all outputs to: `output/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<group-name>/`

Prints a `rich` summary table on completion: group name, reports generated, delivery status, output path.

## Shared Utilities

### `utils/sla_calculator.py`

```python
def get_sla_status(severity: str, first_found: datetime, remediated: bool) -> dict:
    """Returns status, days_open, days_remaining (negative = overdue), sla_days"""
```

### `utils/tag_helper.py`

```python
def get_all_tags(tio) -> pd.DataFrame
def get_assets_by_tag(tio, tag_category: str, tag_value: str) -> list[str]
def enrich_vulns_with_tags(vulns_df: pd.DataFrame, tio) -> pd.DataFrame
```

CLI: `python utils/tag_helper.py --list-tags` / `--list-tags --category "Business Unit"`

### `exporters/chart_exporter.py`

Consistent color palette across all charts:

- Critical = `#d32f2f` | High = `#f57c00` | Medium = `#fbc02d` | Low = `#388e3c` | Info = `#1976d2`

Matplotlib `.png` for PDF embedding and email CID inline images.
Plotly `.html` (interactive) + `.png` (static) for both attachment and inline use.

---

## Data Fetching Guidelines (`data/fetchers.py`)

- `tio.exports.vulns()` for bulk vulnerability data
- `tio.exports.assets()` for asset enrichment
- `tio.tags.list()` for tag discovery
- Cache fetched data to local `.parquet` during each run to avoid redundant API calls across reports in the same group execution
- `tenacity` exponential backoff for rate limiting
- All fetch functions return a normalized `pd.DataFrame`
- `rich` progress bars for all long-running fetches

---

## Code Quality Requirements

- `if __name__ == "__main__":` with `argparse` on every script
- Full docstrings and type hints throughout
- Timezone-aware datetime handling (UTC)
- `logging` module with rotating file handlers (`logs/app.log`)
- No silent failures — log all errors; on multi-group runs, failures in one group must not stop others
- `requirements.txt` with pinned versions
- `.env.example` with all variables and inline comments

---

1. Prerequisites and install instructions
2. `.env` setup — Tenable credentials and SMTP config
3. `delivery_config.yaml` annotated walkthrough
4. Tag discovery: `python utils/tag_helper.py --list-tags`
